# Object Detection with YOLO

This repository contains a Python implementation of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for real-time object detection in images or videos. The YOLO algorithm is a popular approach for object detection, known for its efficiency and accuracy.

## Features

- Uses pre-trained YOLO weights and configuration files for object detection.
- Supports detection of multiple objects simultaneously in real-time.
- Provides visualization of detected objects with bounding boxes and class labels.
- Easy to use and integrate with existing projects.

## Dependencies

- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-detection-yolo.git
```

2. Download the YOLO weights, configuration file, and class labels:

- YOLO weights: [Download](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)
- YOLO configuration: [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjreddie/darknet/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg)
- COCO class labels: [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjreddie/darknet/master/data/coco.names)

3. Place the downloaded weights file (`yolov3.weights`), configuration file (`yolov3.cfg`), and class labels file (`coco.names`) in the project directory.

4. Run the object detection script:

```bash
python object_detection_yolo.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

Replace `path/to/image.jpg` with the path to your input image.

5. The script will perform object detection on the input image and display the result with bounding boxes and class labels.


## Acknowledgments

- This implementation is based on the original YOLO algorithm by Joseph Redmon et al.
- The pre-trained YOLO weights and configuration files are from the official Darknet repository.

Feel free to contribute, report issues, or provide suggestions for improvement.

Enjoy object detection with YOLO!
